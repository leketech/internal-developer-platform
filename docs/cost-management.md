# Cost Management

## Cost Management Strategy

The Internal Developer Platform implements comprehensive cost management practices to optimize cloud spending while maintaining operational excellence and developer productivity.

### Cost Allocation Model

#### Resource Tagging Strategy

All infrastructure resources follow a standardized tagging schema:

- **Owner**: Team or individual responsible for the resource
- **Project**: Business project or initiative the resource supports
- **Environment**: Development, staging, or production environment
- **Cost Center**: Financial cost center for billing purposes
- **Business Unit**: Organizational unit that owns the resource
